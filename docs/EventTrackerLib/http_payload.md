The EventTracker SDK sends events to the server in JSON format. Below is an example payload:

```json

  "device_info": {
    "architecture": "x86_64",
    "cpu_cores": "8",
    "device_id": "90e02037-2192-4d33-9993-e8c7677b7f06",
    "hostname": "DESKTOP-D4OMPH2",
    "platform": "Windows",
    "ram_mb": "8103"
  },
  "event_lib_version": "1.0.0",
  "events": [
    {
      "event_name": "job_1",
      "timestamp": "2025-06-05T01:52:54",
      {
        "ret_value": "9483943"
      }
    },
    {
      "event_name": "job_1",
      "timestamp": "2025-06-05T01:52:54"
